  this is a sample edge input filter that generates
  multiple output formats.

# NOTES: iptables produces filter 'lines' that must be used as args to the
# '$ iptables' cmd, while Speedway produces stateful iptables filters
# compatible with iptables-restore (most people will prefer speedway)

targets:
  - juniper
  - cisco
  - speedway INPUT
  - ciscoasa asa_in
